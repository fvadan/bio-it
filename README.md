Interactive Biochemistry Module
==================================================

This is a tool created for BMSC 200 (Biochemistry) students at the U of S to understand the concepts
taught in classroom in an interactive fashion. You can checkout the tool [here](http://tayabsoomro.me/projects/interactive-biochemistry-module/)

This project is going to be presented at the Undergraduate Project Symposium hosted by USSU at
the University of Saskatchewan.

Features
-----------

With this tool, students can.

* Generate peptide-chains of their names.
* Test their knowledge of peptide chains by answering questions.
* See the visualizations of different amino acid titration curves.
