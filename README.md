Interactive Biochemistry Module
==================================================

This is a tool created for BMSC 200 (Biochemistry) students at the U of S to understand the concepts
taught in classroom in an interactive fashion. You can checkout the tool [here](http://tayabsoomro.me/projects/interactive-biochemistry-module/)

This project is going to be presented at the Undergraduate Project Symposium hosted by USSU at 
the University of Saskatchewan. 

Features
-----------

With this tool, students can.

* Generate peptide-chains of their names.
* Test their knowledge of peptide chains by answering questions.
* See the visualizations of different amino acid titration curves.


Change Log
---------------

- November 28th, 2017
    - Initial release of the tool.
    - Thoroughly tested the peptide functionality.
    - Released Glycine and Alanine titration animations.


References
------------------

The construction of this project was done with the help of following programs/people.

1. PepDraw - For generate the peptide chain images.
2. D3js - For creating graphs and animations of titration curves.
3. Ruby Ahmed - General help in proofreading the concepts.
4. Dr. Scott Napper - Giving feedback and suggestions for the project.
