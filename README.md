Biochemical Insight of Important Topics (BIO-IT)
==================================================

This is a tool created for BMSC 200 (Biochemistry) students at the U of S to understand the concepts
taught in classroom in an interactive fashion. You can checkout the tool [here](http://tayabsoomro.me/projects/bio-it/)


Features
-----------

With this tool, students can.

* Test their knowledge of peptide chains by answering questions.
* See the visualizations of different amino acid titration curves.
* Memorize the amino acids through the interactive flashcards.
